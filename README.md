# DepiProject (Automated Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker)

## Step1:

#### Install Jenkins and Docker: Set up the Jenkins server and Docker on local or cloud environments.
#### Create a basic Dockerized application: Develop a simple application (e.g., a web app) and Dockerize it.
#### Set up Ansible: Install Ansible for configuration management.
#### Pipeline Plan: Plan the structure of the CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy) and document tasks.

## Step2:

#### Create Jenkins Jobs: Configure Jenkins to build the Dockerized application.
#### Integrate Git: Set up GitHub or GitLab repository and integrate with Jenkins for continuous integration.
#### Automated Testing: Add basic testing (e.g., unit tests) into the Jenkins pipeline for automated builds.

## Step3:

#### Integrate Docker Hub or private registry: Push Docker images to Docker Hub or a private registry.
#### Configure Ansible for Deployment: Write Ansible playbooks to automate application deployment to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
#### Deployment Testing: Test deployment process with Docker and Ansible to ensure smooth automation.

## Step4:

#### Kubernetes Integration: Optional task â€” configure Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of Docker containers if desired.
#### Refine the Pipeline: Refine Jenkins jobs for efficiency (e.g., parallel stages, caching).
#### Full Testing and Deployment: Conduct full tests of the CI/CD pipeline, from code commit to deployment.
#### Documentation: Complete documentation of the project, including pipeline design, deployment process, and any issues faced.

## Technologies:

#### Docker, CI-CD/Jenkins, Ansible and AWS public EC2.
